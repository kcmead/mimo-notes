# mimo-notes

This repository contains helpful notes that I've taken from the mimo.org coding courses.

I will add more files as I move throughout the whole full-stack learning flow.

The purpose of this is to solidify what I learned in the coding bootcamp and spend some more time on certain areas that either provided difficulty or I feel is necessary for review.
